5. Close all unnecessary applications and notifications

## Script and Timings

### 0:00-0:15 - Introduction and Home Screen
**Narration:**
"ÉnergIA is an innovative web application that helps Hydro-Québec efficiently monitor electrical infrastructure by using AI to analyze photos and project future vegetation growth. Let's see how it works."

**Action:**
- Show the home screen with the map
- Point to the location marker
- Highlight the information panel

### 0:15-0:40 - Image Capture
**Narration:**
"Users can easily capture images of electrical infrastructure using their device camera or by uploading existing photos. Once captured, the image is securely sent for AI analysis."

**Action:**
- Click on the Capture button
- Switch to the upload option
- Select a pre-prepared demo image (01.jpg)
- Show the image preview
- Click confirm to start processing
- Show the processing animation

### 0:40-1:10 - Analysis Results
**Narration:**
"ÉnergIA's AI analyzes the image to identify key electrical infrastructure components. Each component is annotated with detailed information about its type, condition, and potential vegetation risks."

**Action:**
- Wait for analysis to complete
- Show the annotated image
- Click on different annotations to highlight components
- Point out the information panel showing component details
- Highlight risk indicators and confidence scores

### 1:10-1:40 - Future Projection
**Narration:**
"The most powerful feature of ÉnergIA is its ability to project future vegetation growth and identify potential risks to infrastructure. Users can easily compare current conditions with a 5-year projection."

**Action:**
- Click on the "Vision Futur" button
- Show the future projection view
- Demonstrate the toggle between current and future states
- Use the comparison slider to show both views simultaneously
- Point out areas of concern in the future projection
- Highlight the recommendations in the information panel

### 1:40-2:00 - Conclusion and Benefits
**Narration:**
"By implementing ÉnergIA, Hydro-Québec can proactively identify vegetation risks before they become problems, optimize maintenance schedules, reduce outages, and improve infrastructure reliability. This solution combines the power of AI with practical field applications to create a more resilient electrical grid."

**Action:**
- Return to the home screen
- Show demo mode controls briefly to highlight different scenarios
- End with a clean view of the application

## Recording Tips
1. Use a screen recording software with microphone input
2. Record in a quiet environment to ensure clear narration
3. Practice the complete flow several times before recording
4. Record multiple takes and select the best one
5. Edit out any loading delays if necessary
6. Ensure mouse movements are smooth and deliberate
7. Test the final video on multiple devices

## Post-Recording
1. Save the recording in both MP4 and WebM formats
2. Store on the presentation device and backup USB drive
3. Verify the video plays correctly on the presentation equipment
4. Create a QR code linking to the video for easy access
