# ÉnergIA Development Log

This file tracks the progress of the ÉnergIA demo project development for the Hydro-Québec hackathon.

## Project Overview
ÉnergIA is a web application that enables users to analyze electrical infrastructure using AI. The app allows users to take photos of electrical infrastructure, receive AI analysis of the components, and view future projections of vegetation growth that might impact the infrastructure.

## Development Timeline

### Task 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration ✅
**Completed: May 6, 2025**

#### Work Completed:
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Installed key dependencies:
  - react-webcam for camera access
  - leaflet for map display
  - react-image-annotation for overlay annotations

  - Implemented step-by-step processing visualization
  - Added dynamic progress bar with percentage
  - Created animated visual elements for better UX
- Enhanced overall user experience:
  - Added smooth transitions between capture states
  - Created responsive design for all device sizes
  - Implemented intuitive toggle between camera and upload
  - Added clear error messages and fallbacks

#### Implementation Notes:
- Used TypeScript for all components with proper type definitions
- Implemented React hooks (useState, useRef, useCallback, useEffect) for state management
- Created responsive design that works well on mobile devices
- Added accessibility features including keyboard navigation
- Ensured all components follow the established design system

### Task 4: Backend API Setup and OpenAI Integration ✅
**Completed: May 6, 2025**

  - Added automatic cleanup of expired entries
  - Implemented hit counting for least-recently-used eviction
  - Created quota management for localStorage
  - Added proper cache invalidation strategies
- Implemented comprehensive demo mode:
  - Created pre-cached responses for demo reliability
  - Added realistic analysis data for demo images
  - Set up automatic pre-warming of cache with demo images
  - Implemented fallbacks for offline operation
  - Created utility for converting image URLs to base64

### Task 5-10: Remaining Tasks ⏳
**Status: Not Started**

## Running the Project
- Install dependencies: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Run development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Run production build: `npm start`

## Important Notes
- The project uses Next.js Pages Router (not App Router)
- Environment variables must be set in .env.local before running
- The demo is designed to work offline with pre-cached responses
