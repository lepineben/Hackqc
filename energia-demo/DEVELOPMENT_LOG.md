# ÉnergIA Development Log

This file tracks the progress of the ÉnergIA demo project development for the Hydro-Québec hackathon.

## Project Overview
ÉnergIA is a web application that enables users to analyze electrical infrastructure using AI. The app allows users to take photos of electrical infrastructure, receive AI analysis of the components, and view future projections of vegetation growth that might impact the infrastructure.
