# ÉnergIA Development Log

This file tracks the progress of the ÉnergIA demo project development for the Hydro-Québec hackathon.

## Project Overview
ÉnergIA is a web application that enables users to analyze electrical infrastructure using AI. The app allows users to take photos of electrical infrastructure, receive AI analysis of the components, and view future projections of vegetation growth that might impact the infrastructure.

## Development Timeline

### Task 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration ✅
**Completed: May 6, 2025**

#### Work Completed:
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Installed key dependencies:
  - react-webcam for camera access
  - leaflet for map display
  - react-image-annotation for overlay annotations
  - axios for API requests
  - openai for API integration
- Created project structure with directories:
  - components/ - Reusable UI components
  - pages/ - Next.js pages and API routes
  - lib/ - Utility functions and services
  - public/ - Static assets
  - styles/ - Global CSS
- Built basic components:
  - Layout component with responsive design
  - Map component using Leaflet
  - InfoPanel for location information
  - CaptureButton for navigation
- Set up environment variables for OpenAI API
- Created API routes:
  - /api/analyze-image - For processing captured images
  - /api/generate-future - For future projections
- Implemented caching mechanism for API responses

#### Notes:
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when installing dependencies due to compatibility issues with react-image-annotation
- Created fallback data for demo reliability
- Set up the home page with a basic map and UI elements

### Task 2: Home Screen Implementation ✅
**Completed: May 6, 2025**

#### Work Completed:
- Enhanced map integration with proper markers and styling:
  - Added custom marker with popup
  - Implemented loading animation for map
  - Added informational overlay
  - Created radius circle around the marker for better visibility
  - Made map responsive on different screen sizes
- Improved the InfoPanel component:
  - Added detailed location information
  - Implemented status indicator with color coding
  - Created animated loading transition
  - Added progress bar for vegetation density
  - Organized information in clear sections with better styling
- Enhanced CaptureButton with animations and interactions:
  - Added entrance animation
  - Implemented hover and click effects
  - Added pulse animation for better visibility
  - Included camera icon for better UX
  - Made button responsive for different screen sizes
- Optimized overall home page layout:
  - Added proper page title and description
  - Improved container layout with better spacing
  - Enhanced page transitions for smoother UX
  - Made all elements properly responsive
  - Fixed Leaflet CSS integration

#### Implementation Notes:
- Used Tailwind CSS extensively for styling
- Implemented CSS transitions and animations for smoother UX
- Fixed common Leaflet issues in Next.js (CSS imports, marker icons)
- Added proper loading states to improve perceived performance
- Created responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

### Task 3: Camera and Image Upload Implementation ⏳
**Status: Not Started**

#### Planned Work:
- Implement webcam access using react-webcam
- Create file upload alternative with drag-and-drop
- Build image preview functionality
- Add upload/processing animation

### Task 4: Backend API Setup and OpenAI Integration ⏳
**Status: Not Started**

#### Planned Work:
- Complete OpenAI API integration
- Enhance caching mechanism
- Implement error handling
- Create better mock data for demo reliability

### Task 5-10: Remaining Tasks ⏳
**Status: Not Started**

## Running the Project
- Install dependencies: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Run development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Run production build: `npm start`

## Important Notes
- The project uses Next.js Pages Router (not App Router)
- Environment variables must be set in .env.local before running
- The demo is designed to work offline with pre-cached responses
