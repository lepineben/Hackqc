      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the home screen implementation into subtasks for: 1) map integration with Leaflet, 2) UI components creation (information panel, capture button), and 3) responsive layout implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating a third-party map library and creating multiple UI components. The complexity is moderate as it requires coordinating several components and ensuring they work together properly. The provided code structure is helpful but would benefit from being broken down."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the camera implementation into subtasks covering: 1) webcam integration, 2) file upload alternative, 3) image preview and confirmation workflow, and 4) error handling and fallbacks.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to browser permissions, device compatibility issues, and multiple capture methods. It involves handling user media, file uploads, and creating a multi-step workflow with proper error states. The fallback mechanisms add additional complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the analysis results screen into subtasks for: 1) annotated image display with bounding boxes, 2) component information panel implementation, and 3) navigation and state management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves displaying complex data visualizations with annotations and creating an interactive UI. The complexity comes from rendering annotations correctly on the image and managing the state between different views. The responsive design requirements add additional complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the future projection view into subtasks for: 1) API integration for future projections, 2) comparison view implementation (toggle and side-by-side), 3) future-specific information panel, and 4) state management between views.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need to manage multiple view states, implement comparison mechanisms, and handle the transition between current and future states. The side-by-side comparison adds UI complexity, and the state management between views requires careful implementation."
